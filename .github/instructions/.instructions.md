You are an expert in TypeScript, Angular, and scalable web application development. You write maintainable, performant, and accessible code following Angular and TypeScript best practices.
## TypeScript Best Practices
- Use strict type checking
- Prefer type inference when the type is obvious
- Avoid the `any` type; use `unknown` when type is uncertain
## Angular Best Practices
- Always use standalone components over NgModules
- Do NOT set `standalone: true` inside the `@Component`, `@Directive` and `@Pipe` decorators
- Use signals for state management
- Implement lazy loading for feature routes
- Use `NgOptimizedImage` for all static images.
- Always create full components for routes, even if they are just a single component. 
- Do NOT use the `@HostBinding` and `@HostListener` decorators. Put host bindings inside the `host` object of the `@Component` or `@Directive` decorator instead
- Always use reactive forms over template-driven forms
- Use `ng-container` for structural directives to avoid unnecessary DOM elements
- Use `ng-template` for reusable templates
- Always create forms with strongly typed form controls
- Always use Angular Material and its states
- Always use Angular CDK for drag and drop, virtual scrolling, and other advanced features
- Use Angular CLI for generating components, services, and other code scaffolding   
- Always use `HttpClient` for HTTP requests
- Use interceptors for handling authentication and error handling
- Always unsubscribe from observables to prevent memory leaks, use the `async` pipe or `takeUntil` operator
- Use Angular's built-in internationalization (i18n) for multi-language support
- Always write unit tests for components, services, and other code
- Use Jasmine and Karma for unit testing
## Components
- Keep components small and focused on a single responsibility
- Use `input()` and `output()` functions instead of decorators
- Use `computed()` for derived state
- Set `changeDetection: ChangeDetectionStrategy.OnPush` in `@Component` decorator
- Prefer inline templates for small components
- Prefer Reactive forms instead of Template-driven ones
- Do NOT use `ngClass`, use `class` bindings instead
- DO NOT use `ngStyle`, use `style` bindings instead
- Always use formly typed forms with `FormGroup` and `FormControl`
- any form control should be strongly typed
## State Management
- Use signals for local component state
- Use `computed()` for derived state
- Keep state transformations pure and predictable
- Do NOT use `mutate` on signals, use `update` or `set` instead
## Templates
- Keep templates simple and avoid complex logic
- Use native control flow (`@if`, `@for`, `@switch`) instead of `*ngIf`, `*ngFor`, `*ngSwitch`
- Use the async pipe to handle observables
## Services
- Design services around a single responsibility
- Use the `providedIn: 'root'` option for singleton services
- Use the `inject()` function instead of constructor injection
